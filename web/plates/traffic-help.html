<div class="section text-left help-page">
	<p>The <strong>Traffic</strong> page provides a list of recent aircraft received. Each time a new aircraft is reported, it is added to the list. Each time a new report is received for an existing aircraft, the list is updated. If a report for an aircraft is not received for 3 minutes (180 seconds), the aircraft is removed from the list.</p>
	<p>For each aircraft, the list includes the following details:</p>
	<ul class="list-simple">
		<li><strong>Flight</strong> - either the aircraft tail number / ATC call sign or the ICAO number. When the ICAO number is used, it is displayed in grey.</li>
		<li><strong>Speed</strong> - current reported speed in knots</li>
		<li><strong>Altitude</strong> - current reported altitude and climb/decent rate if when not reporting level flight</li>
		<li><strong>Heading</strong> - direction of reported flight</li>
		<li><strong>Location</strong> - the latitude and longitude reported</li>
		<li><strong>Time</strong> - the last time (UTC) a report was received</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text-warning">NOTE: When this page becomes active (aka it is selected from the menu) it will display any traffic received up to the last 3 minutes (180 seconds). Older traffic will not appear.</p>
