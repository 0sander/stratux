<div class="section text-left help-page">
	<p>The <strong>Towers</strong> page provides a list of recent towers which have been received. Each time a new tower is received, it is added to the list. Each time new messages are received from an existing tower, the list is updated. If no messages are received from a tower for 5 minutes, the tower is removed from the list.</p>
	<p>more details will be added here eventually :-)</p>
