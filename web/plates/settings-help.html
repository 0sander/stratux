    <p>The <strong>Settings</strong> page provides both control and configuration of your Stratux device.</p>

    <p>Use the toggles in the <strong>Hardware</strong> section to control which devices are active.</p>
    <p class="text-warning">NOTE: Only hardware toggled on here, will appear on the
        <stron>Status</stron> page.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Diagnostics</strong> section helps with debugging and communicating with the Stratux project contributors via GitHub and the reddit subgroup.
        <ul class="list-simple">
            <li>Toggling <strong>Traffic Source</strong> adds text for traffic targets within your navigation application. Traffic received via UAT will display <code>u</code> while traffic received via 1090 will display <code>e</code>.</li>
            <li>Toggling <strong>Record Logs</strong> enables logging to a series of files for your Stratux device including data recorded for UAT traffic and weather, 1090 traffic, GPS messages, and AHRS messages. The log files are accessible from the <strong>Logs</strong> menu available on the left.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>The <strong>Configuration</strong> section lets you adjust the default operation of your Stratux device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The SDR (software defined radio) receiver support error correction. From the Raspberry Pi, you may use the command <code>kal -g 48 -s GSM850</code> to scan for available channels in your area. Then use the command <code>kal -g 48 -c <em>channel#</em></code> to calculate the PPM.  <div class="text-warning">NOTE: You will need to perform all commands as <code>root</code> by issuing the command: <code>sudo su -</code>. You will need to stop the Stratux software before running the calibration process. You can stop all of the Stratux processes with the command: <code>pkill screen</code>.</div></li>
        <li>Addiitonal settings will be added in future releases.</li>
    </ul>
